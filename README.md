TODO List project created as part of the Odin Project.

Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and webpack).

This web applications allows users to create projects and tasks within those projects which are stored in local storage. Each task has a title, description, due date and priority.

The page will display lists for "Today", "This Week" as well as each project.

Possible future functionality:

* lists for each priority (low, medium, high) spanning all projects
* ordering of tasks by title, due date, priority
* show/hide completed tasks
